I am the superclass for all rasterizers in the Balloon 3D engine. Rasterizers perform the final pixel generation of the primitives and are the most time-critical part of the engine. Rasterizers keep a viewport, defining the destination rectangle and a dirtyRect, defining the actual affected 2D region of the rasterization process.

Instance variables:
	viewport	<B3DViewport>	the destination rectangle
	dirtyRect	<Rectangle>		the affected region of all rasterization operations performed
