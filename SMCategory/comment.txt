An SMCategory is a "tag" that can be attached to SMCategorizableObjects in order to classify them.

The SMCategories are arranged in a strict hierarchy and each SMCategory both knows it's parent and it's subcategories.
The instvar objects holds all SMObjects belonging to this category.
Instvars name and summary are already inherited from SMObject and describe the category.
The instvar url can be used to refer to a web page that can explain the category in more detail, typically a page at the Squeak Swiki.
SMCategory adds an instance variable called mandatory holding a Set with the classes (SMPackage, SMPackageRelease, SMAccount, SMResource etc) that must belong to at least one subcategory of this SMCategory. Obviously not many categories will be mandatory for each class.

The category tree is maintained by a few trusted people so that chaos will not reign. :-)
