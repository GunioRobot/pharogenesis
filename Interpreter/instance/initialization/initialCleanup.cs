initialCleanup
	"Images written by VMs earlier than 3.6/3.7 will wrongly have the root bit set on the active context. Besides clearing the root bit, we treat this as a marker that these images also lack a cleanup of external primitives (which has been introduced at the same time when the root bit problem was fixed). In this case, we merely flush them from here."
