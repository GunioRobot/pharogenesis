The scroller (a transform) of a scrollPane is driven by the scrollBar.  The scroll values vary from 0.0, meaning zero offset to 1.0 meaning sufficient offset such that the bottom of the scrollable material appears halfway down the pane.  The total distance to achieve this range is called the totalScrollRange.
