	"ASSUMES aSender is a sender of self.  Execute self's stack until aSender returns or an unhandled exception is raised.  Return a pair containing the new top context and a possibly nil exception.  The exception is not nil if it was raised before aSender returned and it was not handled.  The exception is returned rather than openning the debugger, giving the caller the choice of how to handle it."
	"Self is run by jumping directly to it (the active process abandons thisContext and executes self).  However, before jumping to self we insert an ensure block under aSender that jumps back to thisContext when evaluated.  We also insert an exception handler under aSender that jumps back to thisContext when an unhandled exception is raised.  In either case, the inserted ensure and exception handler are removed once control jumps back to thisContext."
