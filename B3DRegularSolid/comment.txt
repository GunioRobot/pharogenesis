An instance represents a platonic solid with colored faces. It is entirely possible to represent these solids using instances of B3DSimpleMesh, but it is instructive to see how a geometric object can be defined by a specialized class. 

To create a platonic solid, send the class of the class methods.

Conventions:
vertices is an array of spacial points.
faces is an array that keeps the faces. Every face is represented by an array that contains the indices of its vertices.

faceNormals is an array of vectors, the face normals. 
The following assertion holds: faces size = faceNormals size.

Transformation methods assume that no spacial point and no vector is contained more than once in any of the collections vertices, vertexNormals, faceNormals.
