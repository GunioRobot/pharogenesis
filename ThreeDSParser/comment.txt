Class ThreeDSParser reads a 3DS File (AutoDesk 3D Studio's native format). It isn't a real parser at all, I chose this name for consistency with the other scene parser classes. For description of 3DS format I used "The Unofficial 3DStudio 3DS File Format v1.0" by Jeff Lewis and the "3ds_bin" by Jim Pitts et. al., see #chunkDocumentation on the Class side.

Instance Variables:
	source		<Stream>	binary stream on source file
	chunkPos	<Integer>	File position of current chunk
	chunkID	<Integer>	ID of current cunk
	chunkLen	<Integer>	Length of current chunk
	indent		<Integer | nil>	If nil, no log is written. Otherwise the current nesting level.
	informer	<Block>		A block taking the progress value while reading
	classSpec	<Dictionary | nil> Specification of the classes to construct.

Class Variables:
	ChunkDescriptions	<Dictionary of: ThreeDSChunkDescription>
		For debugging only. ChunkDescriptions generated from the documentation
	DefaultSpec	<Dictionary | nil>
		The default class specification to use.
