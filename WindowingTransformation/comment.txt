My instances are used to transform objects from a source coordinate system to a destination coordinate system. Each instance contains a scale and a translation which can be applied to objects that respond to scaleBy: and translateBy:. It can be created with a default identity scale and translation, or with a specified scale and translation, or with a scale and translation computed from a window (a Rectangle in the source coordinate system) and a viewport (a Rectangle in the destination coordinate system). In applying a WindowingTransformation to an object, the object is first scaled (around the origin of the source coordinate system) and then translated. WindowingTransformations can be composed to form a single compound transformation.
