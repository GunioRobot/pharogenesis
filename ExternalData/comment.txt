Instances of ExternalData explicitly describe objects with associated type. They can be used for describing atomic C types like arrays of atomic types (e.g., 'int[]') or pointer to atomic types (e.g., 'int *').

Instance variables:
	type	<Integer | Behavior>	The basic type of the receiver.

The encoding of type is equivalent to that of the basic type in class ExternalType. The interpretation of whether the receiver describes an array of data or a pointer to data depends on the contents of the instance variable 'handle'. If handle contains an ExternalAddress the receiver is treated as pointer to type. If the handle contains a ByteArray the receiver is interpreted as describing an array of type. Note that both interpretations are treated equivalent in external calls, e.g., if one describes an argument to an external call as taking 'int*' then, depending on the type of handle either the actual contents (if ExternalAddress) or a pointer to the contents (if ByteArray) is passed.
