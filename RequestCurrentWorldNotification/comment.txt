I provide a way to alter the "currentWorld" in which non-specific things happen. Code which says:

	aMorph openInWorld

for example, will try to open in this "currentWorld" (whose precise definition is still a bit fuzzy). By writing something like:

	[
		someAnonymousStuff happen
	]
		on: RequestCurrentWorldNotification
		do: [ :ex | ex resume: aParticularWorld ]

you can ensure that <aParticularWorld> is used for any non-specific world request during the execution of the block.
