I represent a "creature" that can move about on the surface of a StarSqueak world. I have a position and a heading (direction), and respond commands such as "turnRight:" and "forward:" by turning or moving. I also have an imaginary pen that can draw a trail as I move. In StarSqueak, turtles are born with random positions and headings.

Here are some expressions to try in a workspace:
	w _ StarSqueakMorph new openInWorld.	"make an empty world"
	w makeTurtles: 100.						"create 100 turtles"
	w turtlesDo: [:t | t forward: 1].			"tell all turtles to take a step"
	w turtlesDo: [:t | t goto: 50@50].			"tell all turtles to go to 50@50"
	w turtlesDo: [:t | t forward: 10].			"tell all turtles to take 10 steps"

Structure:
  world				StarSqueakMorph		the world that owns this turtle
  who				integer					unique id
  x					number					x position in world
  y					number					y position in world
  wrapX				float					private; used for wrapping in x
  wrapY			float					private; used for wrapping in y
  headingRadians	float					heading in radians
  color				color					turtle color and its pen color
  penDown			boolean					true if drawing a pen trail
  nextTurtle			StarSqueaktTurtle		private; used to make linked list of turtles
