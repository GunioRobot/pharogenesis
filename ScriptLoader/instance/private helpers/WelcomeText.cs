	^ 'Welcome to Squeak - an open Smalltalk system.

What is this?
Squeak is an open source implementation of Smalltalk with an expansive and rapidly developing world of objects included. 
Squeak includes a fully integrated development environment, networking, sound synthesis and sampling, speech synthesis, 2 & 3D graphics, arithmetic and data structure libraries.
The SqueakMap tool (click on -> "SMLoader open" to start it) tool provides easy access to a large range of packages and projects.
Even the tools to produce the its own virtual machine (VM) are available so that you can build your own - and most of the VM is written in Smalltalk. Not only is all the Smalltalk source code included and changeable at will, it is also completely open and free. The Squeak system image runs bit-identically across all platforms, and VMs are available for just about every computer and operating system available.
