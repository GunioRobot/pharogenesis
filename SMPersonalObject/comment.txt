SMPersonalObject is the abstract base class for things that belong/are owned by a user account in SqueakMap. Most things are personal objects - but the SMCategories aren't for example.

A personal object has a reference to the SMAccount owning it. It also has a potential list of maintainers - other accounts that also can modify the object.
