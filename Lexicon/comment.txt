An instance of Lexicon shows the a list of all the method categories known to an object or any of its superclasses, as a "flattened" list, and, within any selected category, shows all methods understood by the class's instances which are associated with that category, again as a "flattened" list.  A variant with a search pane rather than a category list is also implemented.

categoryList				the list of categories
categoryListIndex		index of currently-selected category
targetObject				optional -- an instance being viewed
targetClass				the class being viewed
lastSearchString			the last string searched for
lastSendersSearchSelector	the last senders search selector
limitClass				optional -- the limit class to search for
selectorsVisited			list of selectors visited
selectorsActive			not presently in use, subsumed by selectorsVisited
currentVocabulary		the vocabulary currently installed
currentQuery			what the query category relates to:
							#senders #selectorName #currentChangeSet
