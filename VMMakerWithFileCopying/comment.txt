This subclass of VMMaker is a hopefully temporary way to provide the copying of files from platforms/{Cross|foo} to src/ until all platforms are able to do their compiling with the platforms tree in place.

The default class will NOT do the file copies and gradually the platform specific classes can be removed as they all catch up.
