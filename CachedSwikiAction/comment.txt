CachedSwikiAction caches SwikiAction pages so that they can be served as plain HTML files (no embedded Squeak code) even by a native webServer. 

You must edit three class methods in CachedSwikiAction to get it to serve appropriately.

* CachedSwikiAction class defaultCacheDirectory is where to store cached pages
* CachedSwikiAction class defaultCacheURL is the URL to precede cached pages
* CachedSwikiAction class defaultPWSURL is where the PWS is that can handle editing and searching.
