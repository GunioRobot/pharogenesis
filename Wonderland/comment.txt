What is Squeak-Alice?

Alice (http://www.alice.org) is an authoring tool designed to allow people without programming experience to build interactive 3D worlds. The Stage 3 Research Group (Randy Pausch director) started the Alice project at the University of Virginia, and is continuing their work at Carnegie Mellon University (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~stage). Squeak-Alice brings the ideas and the ideals of Alice to Squeak, with the goal of introducing even more people to 3D graphics and allowing them to author in the medium.

Wonderlands are the basic building blocks of Squeak-Alice; a Wonderland is an interactive 3D world.

To create a Wonderland, evaluate:

Wonderland new

This creates a script editor, a control panel, and a window into the 3D world. From here you're ready to start building your world.
