RuleDate instances represent dates determined by some rule (first Tuesday in March, etc.) but the exact day of the month varies from year to year.  Once created they must be updated for a selected year to represent the exact day of that year.

Typical Use:

	RuleDate instances are suitable for representing dates such as election day, or the start of daylight saving time in the USA.

Implementation:

Instance variables:

	dayOfWeek		- a <Symbol> representing the day name of the
					week (Sunday, etc) of the desired day.
	selectionRule	- a <Symbol> representing the position (first, last)
					of the desired day in the list of days occurring
					on that day of the week in the desired month.
