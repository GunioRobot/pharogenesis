A WonderlandWrapperMorph is temporarily created by Cmd-Clicking on an object in a 3D world. The wrappers map the behavior of morphs into 3D worlds so that 2D interactions result in appropriate changes in the 3D world (e.g., dragging, resizing) and state changes as well (e.g., color).

Wrappers are created as a hierarchical morph list on the object they represent. This is necessary to allow accesses to higher levels in the 3D hierarchy. Note that there are currently several inconsistent behaviors for 3D objects. This is related to the ridiculous attempt of HandMorph to completely understand the interaction hierarchy, e.g., the HandMorph dispatches all events to what it *thinks* the receiver should be. Naturally, this fails completely for 3D worlds where there is no hierarchy of morphs but which may nevertheless use input events.
