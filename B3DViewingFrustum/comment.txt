I represent a viewing frustum, defined by the following values:

	typedef struct B3DViewingFrustum {
		float left;
		float right;
		float top;
		float bottom;
		float near;
		float far;
	} B3DViewingFrustum;

The frustum can be converted into either a ortho matrix (having no perspective distortion) or a perspective matrix for use in the Balloon 3D render engine.
