TextMorphs support display of text with emphasis.  They also support reasonable text-editing capabilities, as well as imbedded hot links, and the (soon to be released) ability to embed submorphs in the text.  If text has been embedded in another object, one can elect to fill the owner's bounds, in which case the text will be laid out in the shape of the owner's shadow image (including any submorphs othe than the text).  One can also elect to have the text avoid occlusions, in which case it will avoid the bounds of any sibling morphs that appear in front of it.  It may be necessary to update bounds in order for the text runaround to notice the presence of a new occluding shape.
