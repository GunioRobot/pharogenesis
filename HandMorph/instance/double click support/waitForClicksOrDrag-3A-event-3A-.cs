waitForClicksOrDrag: aMorph event: evt
	"Wait until the difference between click, double-click, or drag gesture is known, then inform the given morph what transpired. This message is sent when the given morph first receives a mouse-down event. If the mouse button goes up, then down again within DoubleClickTime, then 'doubleClick: evt' is sent to the morph. If the mouse button goes up but not down again within DoubleClickTime, then the message 'click: evt' is sent to the morph. Finally, if the button does not go up within DoubleClickTime, then 'drag: evt' is sent to the morph. In all cases, the event supplied is the original mouseDown event that initiated the gesture. mouseMove: and mouseUp: events are not sent to the morph until it becomes the mouse focus, which is typically done by the client in its click:, doubleClick:, or drag: methods."
