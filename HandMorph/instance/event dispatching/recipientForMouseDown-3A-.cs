recipientForMouseDown: evt
	"Return the morph that should handle the given mouseDown: event."
	"Details: To get mouse events, a morph must
		a. contain the point at which the mouse went down, and
		b. respond true to handlesMouseDown:, and
		c1. be in front of all other submorphs that respond true to handlesMouseDown: or
		c2. be the outer-most submorph that responds true to preemptsMouseDown:
If no morph handles the mouse down, the front-most submorph is grabbed. The complexity in this description arises from the need to resolve conflicts when nested submorphs all want to handle mouse events. The preemptsMouseDown: mechanism allows a morph to intercept mouse events before its submorphs. It is needed only in unusual situations, such as parts bins containing mouse-sensitive objects."
