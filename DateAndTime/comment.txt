I represent a point in UTC time as defined by ISO 8601. I have zero duration.


My implementation uses three SmallIntegers and a Duration:
jdn		- julian day number.
seconds	- number of seconds since midnight.
nanos	- the number of nanoseconds since the second.

offset	- duration from UTC.

The nanosecond attribute is almost always zero but it defined for full ISO compliance and is suitable for timestamping.
