Defines the fixture to run multiple tests plus the tests using this fixture. To define a test case

  * implement a subclass of TestCase,
  * define instance variables that store the state of the fixture,
  * initialize the fixture state by overriding TestCase setUp,
  * clean-up after a test by overriding TestCase tearDown, and

Each test runs in its own fixture so there can be no side effects among test runs.

For each test in the context of this fixture set-up,

  * implement a method(s) which interacts with the fixture.

In the test method(s) verify the expected results with assertions specified by calling

  * TestCase assert:
  * TestCase deny:
  * TestCase should:
  * TestCase shouldnt:
  * TestCase value:shouldRaise: or
  * TestCase value:shouldntRaise:

with arguments of the expected type.
