I create a set of "stub" widgets that are useful for testing. Instead of drawing themselves in some GUI, they simulate graphical widgets for testing purposes. Through my widgets, unit tests can simulate user actions and make assertions about the state of the display.

See TestRunnerPlusTest for examples.
