I am a view used to display a Scene. I may be scrolled by adjusting my offset. My default controller is SceneController.

SceneViews encapsulate the notion of a changing foreground and a fixed background during interactive updates. During an interaction (such as dragging), some of the glyphs will not change location or appearance. These are part of the "background". All glyphs that may change (the "foreground" glyphs) are painted against this unchanging backdrop during the interaction.

Instance Variables:
	offset				the current offset of this view (used for scrolling)
	enclosingRect 		a rectangle large enough to contain all the objects in the scene, plus a small border (this is a cache that must be recomputed when glyphs are moved, added, or removed from the scene)
	backgroundForm		a <Form> containing the fixed background
	visibleForeground		the glyphs that are changing but not selected during an interaction
	selectedForeground	the selected glyphs that are changing during an interaction
