I am a controller for SceneViews. I support gestures for scrolling, click-selection, and area selection of scene glyphs. (See the class comment in GestureController for more details about gestures.) I also support construction operations such as inserting new glyphs and merging glyphs to make them share a common point.

The mapping of gestures to actions is as follows (see GestureController comment for more about gestures):

  Click:
	click on glyph				select glyph
	shift-click on glyph			toggle selection of that glyph
	click on background			clear selection
  Double click:
	double-click on glyph			inspect glyph
	double-click on background		select all
  Hold/Drag/Sweep:
	hold (no movement)			yellow-button menu
	drag (up/left movement)		scrolling hand
	sweep (down/right movement)	select glyphs in region
	shift-sweep					toggle selection of glyphs in region
