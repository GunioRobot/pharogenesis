This class implements the basic functionality of Animations for Wonderlands. All animations pass through 4 specific stages:

Waiting - this is the state animations are in when they are just started, before they run their prologue (perform any tasks they need to do before the animation actually starts)

Running - this is the state animations are in when they are actually running

Stopped - this is the state animations are in after they stop running but before they execute their prologue

Finished - this is the state animations are in after they finish their epilogue (perform any tasks they need to do after the animation completes).
