Holds all the information needed to read or write on a directory of an internet server.  I am used for FTP and HTTP (and STMP?  NNTP?).  The password policy is: unless it is a public password (like annomyous), clear all passwords before any snapshot.  There is a way to store passwords on the disk.

server 		'www.disney.com'  or '123.34.56.08' or the ServerDirectory above me 
			(if I am a subdirectory sharing the info in a master directory)
directory 	'ftp/pubs/'  name of my directory within the server or superdirectory.
type 		#ftp	what you can do in this directory
user 		'Jones45'
password 	an instance of Password.  
group 		an Association ('group name' -> an array of ServerDirectorys)
			If this first one is down, try the next one.  Store on all of them.  I am in the list.
moniker 	'Main Squeak Directory'  Description of this directory.
url			When a FTP server holds some web pages, the url of those pages is often
			different from the FTP directory.  Put the url here.  If the directory is 
			'public_html/Squeak/', the url might be 'www.webPage.com/~kaehler2/Squeak/'
