An InputSensor is an interface to the user input devices.
There is at least one (sub)instance of InputSensor named Sensor in the system.

Class variables:

ButtonDecodeTable <ByteArray> - maps mouse buttons as reported by the VM to ones reported in the events.

KeyDecodeTable <Dictionary<SmallInteger->SmallInteger>> - maps some keys and their modifiers to other keys (used for instance to map Ctrl-X to Alt-X)

InterruptSemaphore <Semaphore> - signalled by the the VM and/or the event loop upon receiving an interrupt keystroke.

InterruptWatcherProcess <Process> - waits on the InterruptSemaphore and then responds as appropriate.
