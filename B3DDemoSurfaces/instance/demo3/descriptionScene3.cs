descriptionScene3

  ^'Two intersecting surfaces are drawn. Triangular meshes are used for both surfaces. Both surfaces are drawn with textures. Two directional lights and three spotlights are used to illuminate the scene. 

Surface coloring with lights requires the computation of vertex normals.

Proposal for further work:
Remove the textures (in method createSolidForScene3:). It is also a nice idea to draw one surface with texture and one without.'
