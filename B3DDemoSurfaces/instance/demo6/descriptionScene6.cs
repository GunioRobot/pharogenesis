descriptionScene6

  ^'A helix is drawn. A triangular mesh and vertex coloring are used together with a white ambient light.

The example shows that vertex coloration can be used to visualize an additional parameter - in the example the arc length of the helix.

This solid rotates very slowly. This is an indication that rendering of meshes with colored vertices is time consuming.'
