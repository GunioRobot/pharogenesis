  ^'The profile of the function f(x, y) := 4*x*exp(-x^2 - y^2)  is drawn. The profile is approximated by a triangular mesh. Vertex coloring is used to color the surface. Vertex normals are not needed. A white ambient light is used.

The body has a dark gray as its own color. You can remove the material (in method createSolidsForScene8:), the body becomes than darker. The use of a material demonstrates the combination of vertex coloring with material properties.'
