I am a named element of a B3DScene. I store a geometric object together with its texture and its material properties.

Instance variables:
name
A string that can be used to identify the geometric object.

matrix
material
A structure that describes the color of the object surface and its properties under different lights. This feature is not always needed; it should be present when you use light sources to color a scene.

texture
A specialized form. Not mandatory. When present, it will be used to render the object surface. Textures are often an attractive way to color a scene when you do not want to use colored lights.

geometry
a structure that defines the surface of the geometric object. That structure is either a kind of a mesh or an instance of a subclass of B3DGeometry. A mesh uses a collection of adjancent triangles (or quadrangles) to approximate a surface. A dedicated subclass of B3DGeometry may implement other techniques to represent a body.
