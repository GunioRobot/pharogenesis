In the past, BookMorphs had the ability to have each page be on the server as a .sp SqueakPage file.  The index of the book was a .bo file.  In text, Cmd-6 had a LinkTo option that linked to a page by its name, or created a new page of that name.  It assumed the book was on a server with a file per page.  Ted removed that code, and kept a copy on his disk in 'TME-ChngEmphasis.st for .bo .sp'
