This plugin is a fake. It doesn't do anything useful. It's sole purpose is to wrap the C code that's associated with the SurfacePlugin into the main VM generation process. Since the C code isn't easily generated from ST code this is (unfortunately) necessary. But look on the bright side - you don't have to define any weird stuff for the C compiler. Isn't that great?! (just kidding...)
