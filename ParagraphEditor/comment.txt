I am a Controller for editing a Paragraph. I am a kind of ScrollController, so that more text can be created for the Paragraph than can be viewed on the screen. Editing messages are sent by issuing commands from a yellow button menu or from keys on the keyboard. My instances keep control as long as the cursor is within the view when the red or yellow mouse button is pressed; they give up control if the blue button is pressed.
