bitPatternForDepth: depth
	"The raw call on BitBlt needs a Bitmap to represent this color.  I already am Bitmap like.  I am already adjusted for a specific depth.  Interpret me as an array of (32/depth) Color pixelValues.  BitBlt aligns the first element of this array with the top scanline of the destinationForm, the second with the second, and so on, cycling through the color array as necessary. 6/18/96 tk"
