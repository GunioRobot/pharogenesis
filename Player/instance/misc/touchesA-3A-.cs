touchesA: aPrototypicalPlayer
	"Answer whether the receiver overlaps any player who wears a Sketch costume and who is of the same class as the prototypicalPlayer and who is wearing the same bitmap, but who is *not that player itself*!  This is an extreme case of a function highly customized (by Bob Arning) to suit a single, idiosycratic, and narrow demo need of Alan's.  Consult:
