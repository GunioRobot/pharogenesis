freeUnreferencedSubclasses
	"Player classes may hold in their class instance variables references
to instances of themselves that are housekeepingwise unreachable. This
method allows such loops to be garbage collected. This is done in three
steps:
	1. Remove user-created subclasses from the 'subclasses' set and from
Smalltalk. Only remove classes whose name begins with 'Player' and which
have no references.
	2. Do a full garbage collection.
	3. Enumerate all Metaclasses and find those whose soleInstance's
superclass is this class. Reset the subclasses set to this set of
classes, and add back to Smalltalk."
