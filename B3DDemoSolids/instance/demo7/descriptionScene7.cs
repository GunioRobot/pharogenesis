  ^'A dodecahedron with colored vertices. An instance of the specialized geometric object B3DRegularSolid is used to represent and to render that solid.
All 12 faces of the solid are colored with the same vertex coloring. The face coloring is computed from the vertex colors by interpolation. All vertex colors of a face have the same hue and brightness, but different saturations. This special coloring demonstrates that it is sometimes better to use the hue-sturation-brightness color model. (The r-g-b model is often used because it reflects a basic property of a color screen. The problem with that model is that you cannot forecast the resulting color from a given combination of r-g-b values.)
 
No lights, no texture and no materials are needed to show that solid with colored faces.'
