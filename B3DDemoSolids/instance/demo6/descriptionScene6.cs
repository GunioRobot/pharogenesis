  ^'A dodecahedron with colored vertices. An instance of the specialized geometric object B3DRegularSolid is used to represent and to render that solid.
All 12 faces of the solid are colored with the same vertex coloring. The face coloring is computed from the vertex colors by interpolation. 
No lights, no texture and no materials are needed to show that solid with colored faces.'
