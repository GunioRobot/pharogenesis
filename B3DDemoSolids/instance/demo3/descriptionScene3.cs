descriptionScene3

  ^'A dodecahedron with colored faces. The colors of the points (instances of B3DSimpleMeshVertex) determine the color of a face. Here all five vertices of a face have the same color.  Pointsymmetric faces have the same colors.

 No lights, no texture and no materials are needed to show that solid with colored faces.

Note that this requires a minor change in B3DSimpleMeshFace>>renderOn:'
