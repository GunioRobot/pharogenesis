  ^'Two dodecahedra with colored faces.

 No lights, no texture and no materials are needed to show that solid with colored faces.

The scene was build with geometric transformations. Note that B3DSimpleMesh does not implement in place transformation: The method #transformBy:  returns a new instance.'
