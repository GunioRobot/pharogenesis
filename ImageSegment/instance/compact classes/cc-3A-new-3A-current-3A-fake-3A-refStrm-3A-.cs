	"Sort out all the cases and decide what to do.  Every Fake class is uncompacted before having insts converted.  As the segment is installed, instances of reshaped compact classes will have the wrong class.  Trouble cases:
	1) Existing class is compact in the segment and not compact here.  Make that compact, (error if that slot is used), load the segment.  If an class was just filed in, it is an existing class as far as we are concerned.
	2) A compact class has a different shape.  We created a Fake class.  Load the segment, with instances in the seg having the Wrong Class!!  Find the bad instancees, and copy them over to being the real class.
	3) An existing class is not compact in the segment, but is in the image.  Just let the new instance be uncompact.  That is OK, and never reaches this code.
	A class that is a root in this segment cannot be compact.  That is not allowed."
