Arcs are an unusual implementation of splines due to Ted Kaehler.  Imagine two lines that meet at a corner. Now imagine two moving points; one moves from the corner to the end on one line, the other moves from the end of the other line in to the corner.  Now imagine a series of lines drawn between those moving points at each step along the way (they form a sort of spider web pattern).  By connecting segments of the intersecting lines, a smooth curve is achieved that is tangent to both of the original lines.  Voila.
