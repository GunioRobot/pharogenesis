I am the core of a mail reading and organizing program. The name "Celeste" is a reference to an earlier mail reader named "Babar", which was written at Xerox PARC by Steve Putz and John Maloney.

This object provides a user interface and some higher-level functionality for the application. The foundation of of the mail reader is really the mail database, implemented by the class MailDB.

Implementation note: the 'mailDB' instance variable can be nil.  This way, it is possible to have a Celeste window with no DB currently loaded.  All user-accessible functions that access mailDB should be careful to quietly do nothing if mailDB is nil.  The purpose is to provide a useful prototype window for new users.

This class is abstract.  The concrete subclasses provide slightly different interfaces.

Fixes bug with CelesteAddressBook
Symptom: send a message causes walkback

Analysis: CelesteAddressBook>buildMessageForSelectedContact
needs access to MailAccount.

Fix: Modify CelesteAddressBook to hold reference to
Celeste, rather than MailDB.  The address book
can access the MailAccount and the MailDB via Celeste.
The AddressBook must now be opened from the Celeste
mail browser, and cannot be opened independently.

Also, I removed the acknowledgement following Celeste
fetch mail.
