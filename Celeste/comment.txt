I am the core of a mail reading and organizing program. The name "Celeste" is a reference to an earlier mail reader named "Babar", which was written at Xerox PARC by Steve Putz and John Maloney.

This object provides a user interface and some higher-level functionality for the application. The foundation of of the mail reader is really the mail database, implemented by the class MailDB.
