	1. The custom menu button always presents a menu; matching filters are
	   listed at the top of the the menu.

	2. The auto-move button is removed.  Instead, the regular TOC menu will
	   give the option of an automove.

	3. Huge message lists are not shown, but a menu item is added to forcibly
	   show all messages.  You can also specify the maximum number to display.

	4. The From Filter is switched to a Participant Filter.

	5. The table of contents pane uses a new multi-column list morph, which makes
	   for nicer looking lists.

	6. Messages that have attachments are indicated with @.

	7. If attachments are jpeg or gif then open view will correctly process the image,
	   and save will suggest a proper extension for the file name.

	8. The delete button is back.

	9. The morphic panes use the new fixed pane scheme (layouts).

	10. The status pane is displayed depending on an option in Preferences.  Default is
	    to not show the status pane.

	11. Menus use checkbox style for some of the options:
	    (suppress header, and leave messages on server).'
