	"Normalize the receiver. Note that the actual angle (a) determining the amount of 
	rotation is fixed, since we do not want to modify angles. This leads to:
		a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 1.
		b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 1 - a^2.
	Note also that the angle (a) can not exceed 1.0 (due its creation by cosine) and
	if it is 1.0 we have exactly the unit quaternion ( 1, [ 0, 0, 0]).
