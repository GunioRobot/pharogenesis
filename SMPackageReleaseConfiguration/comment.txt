A package release configuration describes the result of testing the specific release with a set of other releases that it depends on.
The status instvar holds a symbol which reflects the result. Currently there are two valid values:
	#working
	#failing
	
The intention is that users and maintainers post these configurations to the map as "known working combinations of required releases".
Each SMPackageRelease can then have multiple of these configurations.
