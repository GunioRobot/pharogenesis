An SMCard is a library card describing a Squeak code package. It is the object representing a particular
package and currently it has information about the current version available of the package.

It contains a minimal amount of information as follows:

name			A String with a name for the package. The card has an id too so the name is not what makes the card unique.
currentVersion	A String with the readable version of the package. This can follow whatever style the author wants.
summary		A oneline String describing shortly what the package is in one sentence.
description		A 5-10 lines String describing the package in full.
url				A String with the url to the WWW homepage of the package if it has one.
downloadUrl		A String with the url to a download of the package.
author			A String with the original author in format 'Joe Schmoe <joe@schmoe.com>'.
maintainer		A String with the current package maintainer in format 'Joe Schmoe <joe@schmoe.com>'.
registrator		A String with the the person registrating the card in format 'Joe Schmoe <joe@schmoe.com>'.
password		A String with the password that the registrator selected when registering the card.
versionComment	A String describing the specific version of the package.
categories		An OrderedCollection with the SMCategories that this card belongs to.

Of all these variables only the last one - categories is not a simple String. When being stored or transmitted we use the UUIDs of the SMCategory objects instead and then "reconnect" them using real references.
