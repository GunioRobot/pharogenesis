I represent a hardware accelerated 3D display. Usually, this means some sort of offscreen buffer (so that we can do efficient compositing for the 2D case) but it might be different.

The first implementation uses Direct3D on Windows where compositing is trivially achieved by using DirectDrawSurfaces which can be accessed by either 2D or 3D operations.
