In a system with 7780 methods, we got 83k of temp names, or around 100k with spaces between.  The order of letter frequency was eatrnoislcmdgpSub, with about 60k falling in the first 11.  This suggests that we could encode in 4 bits, with 0-11 beng most common chars, and 12-15 contributing 2 bits to the next nibble for 6 bits, enough to cover all alphaNumeric with upper and lower case.  If we get 3/4 in 4 bits and 1/4 in 8, then we get 5 bits per char, or about 38% savings (=38k in this case).

Summary: about 13 bytes of temp names per method, or 8 with simple compression, plus 1 for the size.  This would be 5 bytes more than the current 4-byte trailer.
