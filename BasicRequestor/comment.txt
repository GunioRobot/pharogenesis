This class is the root of the Requestor hierarchy.

Requestors are interfaces between services and the system. ServiceActions are given an instance
of a Requestor, and they ask it for the data they need. The requestor is determined by the model of the application. A class used as a model can implement the #requestor message to return the most suited requestor. A requestor knows how to query its model and the user if needed.

Requestor are defined in hierarchies so that the protocol they rely on (methods starting with 'get') can be easily reused.
