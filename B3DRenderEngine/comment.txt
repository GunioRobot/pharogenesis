I represent a facade for all Balloon 3D operations. Clients should only interact with me, not with any of the parts of the engine directly. However, clients may configure me to use certain parts in the 3D rendering pipeline.

Instance variables: 
	vertexBuffer 	<B3DVertexBuffer>	The vertex buffer passed on through the entire pipeline
	transformer 	<B3DEnginePart>		The part performing transform operations
	shader 			<B3DEnginePart>		The part performing vertex shading operations
	clipper 			<B3DEnginePart>		The part performing view frustum clipping
	rasterizer		<B3DEnginePart>		The part performing final pixel rasterization
