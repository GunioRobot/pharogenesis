	This method looks a bit complicated, and this is mainly because there is no fast search method
	in String that takes a stoppingAt: argument. This means we need to ignore getting hits in the
	dead buffer area above inNextToWrite.
	Another measure is that this implementation is greedy and will load data into the buffer
	until there is nothing more available, or it has loaded 100kb - and not until then we search the buffer.

	A totally non greedy variant would search on every loop."
