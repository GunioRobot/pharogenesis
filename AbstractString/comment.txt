This class provides the abstract super class for the original String (that represents an array of 8-bit Characters) and MultiString (that represents an array of  32-bit MultiCharacters).  In the similar manner of LargeInteger and SmallInteger, those subclasses are chosen accordingly for a string; namely as long as the system can figure out so, the String is used to represent the given string.

	The methods of this class were copied from String. Most of the methods only use #at: and #at:put: to access the elements and don't care about the actual type, so they work ok with proper accessors to the slots.

	Some of the methods of this class call #subclassResponsibility, and some other provides the default behavior and MultiString overrides the default behavior.  Probably there should be a clearer organization in this regard.
