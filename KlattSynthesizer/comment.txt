My instances are Klatt-style cascade/parallel formant synthesizers, first described by Dennis Klatt in [1]. An updated version of the model was described in [2]. This version implements the LF (Liljencrants-Fant) glottal pulse model from [3], and the jitter and shimmer parameters suggested in [4]. For a description of the Klatt parameters, see KlattFrame.
