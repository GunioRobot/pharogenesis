	"If you write a conversion method beware that the class may need a version number change.  This only happens when two conversion methods in the same class have the same selector name.  (A) The inst var lists of the new and old versions intials as some older set of new and old inst var lists.  or (B) Twice in a row, the class needs a conversion method, but the inst vars stay the same the whole time.  (For an internal format change.)
	If either is the case, fileouts already written with the old (wrong) version number, say 2.  Your method must be able to read files that say version 2 but are really 3, until you expunge the erroneous version 2 files from the universe."
