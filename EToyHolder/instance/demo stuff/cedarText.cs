"Hi, I''m Cedar. I just found this really rad thing called ''The Imagineering Studio'' on Disney''s Daily Blast. I know, you think Disney is just for little kids. But when I tell you how learned how to drive a race car, and show you the totally killer car and racetrack I made myself, you won''t think so anymore!"
