DynamicInterpreter comment:
'This class is a complete implementation of the Smalltalk-80 virtual machine, derived originally from the Blue Book specification.

It has been modernized with 32-bit pointers, better management of Contexts, and attention to variable use that allows the CCodeGenerator (qv) to keep, eg, the instruction pointer and stack pointer in registers.

In addition to SmallInteger arithmetic and Floats, it supports logic on 32-bit PositiveLargeIntegers, thus allowing it to simulate itself much more effectively than would otherwise be the case.'
