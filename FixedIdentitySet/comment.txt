This is a fast but lazy implementation of fixed size identity sets. The two main difference to regular identity sets are:

1) These identity sets have a fixed size. If they are full, adding another element doesn't have any effect.
2) No rehashing. If two elements were to be stored on the same position in the underlying array, one of them is simply discarded.

As a consequence of (1) and (2), these identity sets are very fast! Note that this class inherits form Array. This is not clean but reduces memory overhead when instances are created.
