This class and its subclasses act to syncronize movie players with the progress of a MIDI score and further background can be found in the comment for MoviePlayerMorph.

MovieClipStartMorphs are used where you have a movie clip player plex.  You can create such a plex by opening a midi score, spawning a piano roll (by the button of that name), and then choosing 'add movie clip player' from the piano roll menu.  Much simpler, you can open a MoviePlayerMorph as a new morph, and then choose 'make a new movie' from its menu.  This plex then serves as a central editable score for composing movie clips.

To add a new movie clip to the score, open a movie from the fileList (or as a new morph followed by 'open a movie').  Play or otherwise position the clip to the desired starting position, and then tear off a thumbnail and drop it into the score at the desired time.  The starting thumbnail (MovieClipStartMorph) will appear in the score, tied to an endMorph by a colored stripe.  The ending time will be chosen based on the total length of the clip, a default starting clip length (200 frames), and possible interference with other clips that follow it.

To reposition a clip, you can pick up its clipStart with halo black handle, and drop it elsewhere.  The rest of the clip will follow as best it can.  To delete a clip, delete its clipStart.  To change the duration of a clip, play the composition up to some point in that clip, and pause it.  Then use the  controls on the central movie player to move forward or backward to the desired ending frame, and choose 'end clip here' from the player menu.
