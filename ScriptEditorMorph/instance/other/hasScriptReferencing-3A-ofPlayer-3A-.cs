	"Answer whether the receiver has any tiles in it which reference the given slot of the given player.  By doing a text search on the decompiled method, this is able to work both with text and with tiles.  The approach is still not perfect, because we can't really know until run-time whom the getters and setters are sent to.  But practically speaking, this is all presumably a positive."
