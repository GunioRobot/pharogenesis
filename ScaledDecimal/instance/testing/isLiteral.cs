isLiteral
	"Answer if this number could be a well behaved literal.

	This is not the case of all ScaledDecimals.
	Some have an infinite precision and would need an infinite number of digits to print literally.
	Try for example (3.00s2 reciprocal)."

				(numerator * (10 raisedTo; scale)) \\ denominator = 0.
				But since we can assume fraction is reduced already this will be simply:"
