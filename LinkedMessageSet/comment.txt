An instance of me holds a list of methods (or class comment, class defintion, class hierarchy).  When a user clicks on a HyperText link, the place referred to is displayed in me.  The non-method contents are not meant to be edited and accepted.

To create a link to a class comment:
In any piece of text, type the name of a class.
Select it.
Command-6.
Choose 'go to comment of class'
Then a user can click on that text later and she will be transported to the class's comment.

To create a link to a method, class definition, or class hierarchy: Do the same as above, but choose the appropriate menu item.
