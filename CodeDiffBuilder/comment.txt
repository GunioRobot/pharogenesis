I am a differencer that compares source in tokens tokenised by a parser.  I consider comments significant, but consider sequences of whitespace equivalent.  Depending on the definition of WhitespaceForCodeDiff>>at: sequences of whitespace containing carriage-returns may be considered different to sequences of whitespace lacking carriage-returns (which may result in better-formatted diffs).
