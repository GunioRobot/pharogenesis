howToStart
	"To set up your new Swiki, you need a copy of the 'Server' folder
found at:
http://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/mark.guzdial/squeak/pws/
Put the 'Server' folder into the folder that your image is in.

Modify this method to be a path to your Server folder, select it, and
choose fileItIn:
!ServerAction class methodsFor: 'System Services' stamp: 'tk 1/19/98 12:52'!
serverDirectory
	^ 'Hard Disk:Squeak1.31:Server:'
! !

Then do:
	PWS initializeAll.

To enable a new Swiki called OurOwnArea.
Make a folder named OurOwnArea in the Server folder.  Then do:
	SwikiAction setUp: 'OurOwnArea'.
	(its main URL is http://thisMachine:80/OurOwnArea.1)

<<<<There has been a major change between Squeak 2.1 and 2.2.  If you are reloading an existing Swiki for the first time in Squeak 2.2, 
Do this instead of the normal reload.
	SwikiAction new restore: 'myswiki'.		'<- New line for each additional Swiki area'.
	SwikiAction new restore: 'myswiki'.		'Case DOES matter in the name of Swiki here.'.
	(PWS actions select: [ :action | action isKindOf: SwikiAction ])
		do: [ :action | action fixAllLineEndings ].
	PWS serveOnPort: 80 loggingTo: 'log.txt'.
(This to converts LineFeeds to CarriageReturns in all of your swiki data files.  Only do this the first time!)
>>>>>

Suppose you already have a Swiki called 'myswiki'.
To start up:
	SwikiAction new restore: 'myswiki'.		'<- New line for each additional Swiki area'.
	SwikiAction new restore: 'myswiki'.		'Case DOES matter in the name of Swiki here.'.
	PWS serveOnPort: 80 loggingTo: 'log.txt'.

To stop the server:
	PWS stopServer.

-----------------------
To purge a particular file of all except the latest version:
	((PWS actions at: 'myswiki' asLowercase) urlmap atID: '3') condenseChanges.

To roll the entire wiki back to a previous time:
	""This does not erase data, it just copies the older page to the end""
	(PWS actions at: 'myswiki' asLowercase) rollBack: '1/28/98' asDate
			at: '1:30 am' asTime.

The look of a served page is controlled by a template.  Templates live in
the 'swiki' folder in the 'Server' folder.  Beware that templates are
cached by HTMLformatter.  If you change a template, you will not see the
effect until you reload the Swiki.

To set up a Swiki with a password (same for all users), see
AuthorizedSwikiAction comment.

To enable a privledged user to execute code remotely (on a workspace page):
	(PWS actions at: 'authorized') mapName: 'JSmith' password:
'hard2guess' to: 'JSmith'.
	(URL is http://thisMachine:80/authorized.workspace.html)

To backup the user data to the disk, do nothing.  All info is already
inside the page files on the disk.

To enable a new Swiki that evaluates Squeak code submitted by the user.
Make a folder named SqkEval in the Server folder.  Then do:
	ActiveSwikiAction setUp: 'SqkEval'.
	(this is dangerous, because there are still ways a user could crash
your server)

To convert a Swiki with LineFeed line endings to CarriageReturn line
endings, execute these lines:
          (PWS actions select: [ :action | action isKindOf: SwikiAction ])
		do: [ :action | action fixAllLineENdings ]

To convert from an old pre-Squeak1.3 Swiki to the new page format:
	(In the old image, do a backup:)
		| mine | mine _ PWS actions at: 'myswiki'.
		mine saveTo: mine path,'backup28JanA'.
	(Quit.  Start the new image which has this version of the Swiki code)
	(Do not start the server!!!)
		PWS initializeAll.
		SwikiAction restore: 'myswiki' from:
			(ServerAction serverDirectory), 'myswiki:backup28JanA'.
		(PWS actions at: 'myswiki' asLowercase) convert.
	(do these steps for each Swiki you have)
	(now, start the server)
	PWS serveOnPort: 80 loggingTo: 'log.txt'.
