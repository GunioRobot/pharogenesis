PWS is the PluggableWebServer.  Documentation for it can be found at
http://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/mark.guzdial/squeak/pws/.

The PWS decouples the networking and HTTP translation roles of a Web Server
from the URL translation and CGI execution roles. The latter roles are
played by ServerActions.

To record a ServerAction for the PWS, use PWS link: key to: action. Key is
a string that will be parsed out of the incoming URL.

See PWS class howToStart.

PWS (and its associated files) are based on Georg Gollman's WebServer,
extended by Mark Guzdial.  Those portions are copyright 1997 Georgia Tech
Research Corporation and are used with permission.  Mark Guzdial's work on
PWS was funded in part by NSF grant REC-9550458.
