An SMDocument refers typically to a piece of digital information accessible through a URL. :-)
This means it can be downloaded and cached.

The instvar description describes the document and instvar author references the name and/or email of the original author.

SMDocument has two subclasses - SMPackage and SMResource. Since SqueakMap is primarily meant for
keeping track of installable source packages of Squeak software, a specific subclass handles those.

The main difference is that an SMPackage has SMPackageReleases - versions of the package. An SMResource has no versions and is always referred to as it is *now*, but it does have a field for keeping track of the current version name.
