An SMDocument refers typically to a piece of digital information accessible through a URL. :-)
This means it can be downloaded and cached.

The instvar description describes the document and instvar author references the name and/or email of the original author.

SMDocument has one subclasses - SMPackage. Since SqueakMap is primarily meant for
keeping track of installable source packages of Squeak software, a specific subclass handles those.
