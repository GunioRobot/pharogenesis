Process comment:
'I represent an independent path of control in the system. This path of control may be stopped (by sending the message suspend) in such a way that it can later be restarted (by sending the message resume). When any one of several paths of control can be advanced, the single instance of ProcessorScheduler named Processor determines which one will actually be advanced partly using the value of priority.'
