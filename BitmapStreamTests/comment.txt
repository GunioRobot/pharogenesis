This is an incomplete test suite for storing and reading various word- and short-word subclasses of ArrayedCollection.

It demonstrates some problems with filing in of certain kinds of arrayed objects, including:

ShortPointArray
ShortIntegerArray
ShortRunArray
WordArray
MatrixTransform2x3

In 3.6b-5331, I get 8 passed/6 failed/6 errors (not counting the MatrixTransform2x3 tests, which were added later).

I ran into problems when trying to read back the SqueakLogo flash character morph, after I'd done a 'save morph to disk' from its debug menu.

The words within the ShortPointArrays and ShortRunArrays were reversed.
