This makes it possible for packages to extend Morph class vocabularies.
Previously, you'd have to edit #additionsToViewerCategories, which would result in potential conflicts between different packages that all wanted to (for instance) extend Morph's vocabulary.

Subclasses that have additions can do one or both of:
	- override #additionsToViewerCategories (as before)
	- define one or more additionToViewerCategory* methods.

The advantage of the latter technique is that class extensions may be added
by external packages without having to re-define additionsToViewerCategories.

So, for instance, package A could add a method named #additionsToViewerCategoryPackageABasic
and its methods would be added to the vocabulary automatically.

NOTE: this change set is hand-rearranged to avoid problems on file-in.

Specifically, Morph>>hasAdditionsToViewerCategories must come before Morph class>>additionsToViewerCategories
