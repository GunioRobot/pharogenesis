A single class of morph that holds any piece of Smalltalk, and allows it to be a tile.  Tiles can be dragged in or out of a method. 

In the message list pane of a Browser, choose 'tile scriptor'.  Bring up a second one to steal parts from.  

Clicking multiple times selects enclosing phrases of code.  Dragging lets you take away a copy.  Any tile may be replaced by dropping on it.  Shift-click to edit the text of any tile.  Change variable and message names, but do not change the part-of-speech (objects to selector).

Each SyntaxMorph holds a ParseNode.  After editing, the parseNode is only good as a part-of-speech indicator.  Only the classes of the parseNodes are important.  It's state is not kept up to date with the tile edits (but maybe it should be).

The correspondence between SyntaxMorphs and parseNodes in the real parse tree is not one-to-one.  Several extra levels of SyntaxMorph were added as aligners to make the horizontal and vertical layout right.  These sometimes have nil for the parseNode.

When accept the method, we pass over the tree of SyntaxMorphs, gathering their printStrings and inserting punctuation.  See (SyntaxMorph>>printOn:indent:).  We send the result to the compiler.  (We do not use the parse tree we already have.)
