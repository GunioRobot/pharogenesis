A VRMLNodeParser creates a generic tree of VRMLNodes from a VRML file. These nodes are not intended to be used directly in a 3D system; they should be used to create a retained mode description for the 3D rendering system.

Instance variables:
	nodeTypes 	<Collection of: VRMLNodeSpec>	The specs used for construction the VRML nodes
	scene 		<VRMLScene>					The scene which will be defined by the parser
	protoList 	<Collection of: VRMLNodeSpec>	Prototypes currently under construction
	infoBar 	<BlockContext>					Progress indicator

Class variables:
	VRMLFieldTypes 			<Dictionary>		Basic VRML field types
	VRMLRuntimeFieldTypes 	<Dictionary>		The field types in a valid VRML file
	VRMLScriptFieldTypes 		<Dictionary>		The field types for node definitions
	VRMLStatements 			<Dictionary>		The valid statements in a VRML file
