This class was written to mange the external semaphore table. When I was writing a Socket test server I discovered various race conditions on the access to the externalSemaphore table. This new class uses class side methods to restrict access using a mutex semaphore. It seemed cleaner to deligate the reponsibility here versus adding more code and another class variable to SystemDictionary 

Note that in Smalltalk recreateSpecialObjectsArray we still directly play with the table.
