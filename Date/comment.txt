Date comment:
'I represent a date. My printing format consists of an array of six elements.
	
The first three elements contain the numbers 1, 2, 3, in any order. 1 indicates that the day appears in this position, 2 indicates that the month appears in this position, and 3 indicates that the year appears in this position.
	
The fourth element is the ascii value of the character separator or the character itself.
	
The fifth element is the month format, where 1 indicates print as a number, 2 indicates print the first three characters, and 3 indicates print the entire name.
	
The six element is the year format, where 1 indicates print as a number, and 2 indicates print the number modulo 100.
	
Examples:
	#(1 2 3 32 2 1) prints as 12 Dec 1981
	#(2 1 3 $/ 1 2) prints as 12/12/81'
