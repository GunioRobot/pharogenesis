A Comment space is like a bulletin board.  It is a web page with a list statements from many different people.  At the bottom there is a form for you to add your own statement.

Anyone may start a new comment page, just by asking for a page with a new key, and there can be any number of pages.  The default Swiki has a page called 'pws' already created.

The administrator must take special action to save the accumulated comments (Comment saveTo: 'aFileName').  Comments are not automatically stored on the disk like regular Swiki pages are.  So, for the moment, it is likely that Comments will get lost when the server is restarted.

URLs are of the form 
machine:80/Comment.{commentKey}
machine:80/Comment.{commentKey}.{number}
machine:80/Comment.{commentKey}.note   -- Does this really work???  -tk
machine:80/Comment.{commentKey}.gif
