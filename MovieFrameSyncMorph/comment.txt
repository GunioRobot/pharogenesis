This class and its subclasses act to syncronize movie players with the progress of a MIDI score and further background can be found in the comment for MoviePlayerMorph.

There are two main forms of synchroniztion.

MovieFrameSyncMorphs are used where you have a MIDI score open with a piano roll, and a separate MoviePlayer Morph.  A MovieFrameSyncMorph can be torn off from the MoviePlayer with a shift-drag gesture or menu command, and can then be dropped into a MIDI score.  They are used to start a movie player at a given place in the score, and then to stretch or compress the movie frame rate so that certain frames are synchronized with the corresponding points in the score.

MovieClipStartMorphs (q.v.) and MovieClipEndMorphs are used for the other kind of synchronization, namely where you wish to assemble a number of movie clips in a sequence.
