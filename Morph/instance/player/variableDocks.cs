variableDocks
	"Answer a list of VariableDocker objects for docking up my data with an instance held in my containing playfield.  The simple presence of some objects on a Playfield will result in the maintenance of instance data on the corresponding Card.  This is a generalization of the HyperCard 'field' idea.  If there is already a cachedVariableDocks cached, use that.  For this all to work happily, one must be certain to invalidate the #cachedVariableDocks cache when that's appropriate."
