A morph (from the Greek "shape" or "form") is an interactive graphical object.

All morphs owned by a morph are held in submorphs.  

All coordinates are global screen coordinates.  (Except those that are flexed, contained inside a FlexMorph.)

All show on the screen unless they are 'hidden'.  Hidden morphs have the property #hidden set to true.
