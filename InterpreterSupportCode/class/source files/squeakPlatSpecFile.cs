	^ '/* sqPlatformSpecific.h -- Platform-specify prototypes and definitions. */

/* How to use this file:
   This file is for general platform-specific macros and declarations.
   Function prototypes that are unlikely to introduce name conflicts on
   other platforms can be added directly. Macro re-definitions or conflicting
   function prototypes can be wrapped in a #ifdefs. Alternatively, a customized
   version of this file can be used on that platform. The goal is to keep all
   the other header files generic across platforms. To override a definition or
   macro from sq.h, you must first #undef it, then provide the new definition.
