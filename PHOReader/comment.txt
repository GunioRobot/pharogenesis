My instances read PHO files with lines of the form 'phoneme duration time0 pitch0 time1 pitch1 ...'. Time is in milliseconds, and pitch is in hertz. Files on this format are used as inputs for the MBROLA synthesizer, and there are lots of them available on the web. Here's an example:

_  120 0 105
m  60 33 105
E  70 42 102
r  50 20 108
I  50 20 125 100 142
k  100
r  50 80 137
I  50 80 121
s  70
m  50
@  90 33 111 88 108
s  90
