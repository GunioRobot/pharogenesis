I represent a stored persistent representation of a compiled Applescript.  Ultimately, Squeak interfaces should endeavor to coerce Applescript information to me in one form or the other as soon as possible, as I require no special treatment with respect to memory management.  I *WILL*, however, retain state information between executions of applescripts if I was compiled using modes with bits 2 or 3 set.

I am generally kept as an internal value inside of Applescript or Context objects.  To operate on my instances, they are first generally converted to an AEDesc of type 'scpt', and then "loaded" into an Applescript scripting component (represented by an OSAID handle).  The OSAID is used to "work on" the instance.  If changed state information is desired, the modified OSAID must be "stored" from Applescript back to an AEDesc, and then ultimately converted back into another persistent CompiledScript, which can then replace the first instance.
