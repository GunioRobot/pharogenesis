This class represents a set of objects that are known to the primitive level rasterizer. It should not be modified unless you know *exactly* what you're doing. The instance variables could actually be indexed but I decided to give them names for readability.

Instance variables:
	faceAlloc	<B3DPrimitiveRasterizerData>	- Source for primitive level face allocation.
	edgeAlloc	<B3DPrimitiveRasterizerData>	- Source for primitive level edge allocation.
	attrAlloc	<B3DPrimitiveRasterizerData>	- Source for primitive level attribute allocation.
	aet			<B3DPrimitiveRasterizerData>	- Primitive level active edge table.
	addedEdges	<B3DPrimitiveRasterizerData>	- Primitive level temporary edge storage.
	fillList		<B3DPrimitiveRasterizerData>	- Primitive level fill list.
	objects		<B3DPrimitiveRasterizerData> - Primitive level list of objects.
	textures		<B3DPrimitiveRasterizerData> - Primitive level lists of textures.
	spanBuffer	<Bitmap>						- 32bit bitmap to render into
	bitBlt		<BitBlt>						- Final output device
