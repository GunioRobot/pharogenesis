I represent an event that occurs during the computation of line segment intersections.

Instance variables:
	position		<Point>	The position of where this event occurs
	type		<Symbol>	The type of the event
	edge		<LineIntersectionSegment>	The edge associated with this event.
	crossedEdge	<LineIntersectionSegment>	The crossing edge of a #cross event.
