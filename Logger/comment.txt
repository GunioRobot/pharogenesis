Logger comment:
'I am a simple stream wrapper that is used by the DynamicInterpreterSimulator to record execution traces.  I implement stream-like protocol, and either:
	- forward the output to the Transcript;
	- forward the output to a file;
	- throw the output away.
I have a unique instance, bound to the global variable InterpreterLog.'
