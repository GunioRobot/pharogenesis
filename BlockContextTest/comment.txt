I am an SUnit Test of BlockContext and its supertype ContextPart.  See also MethodContextTest.

My fixtures are:
aBlockContext     - just some trivial block, i.e., [100@100 corner: 200@200].

NOTES ABOUT AUTOMATING USER INPUTS

When executing non-interactive programs you will inevitably run into programs (like SqueakMap or Monticello installation packages -- and other programs, to be fair) that require user input during their execution and these sort of problems shoot the whole non-interactiveness of your enclosing program.

BlockContext helper methods have been made available and tests of these helpers are provided in this class to demonstrate that it can intercept PopUpMenu and FillInTheBlankMorph requests for user interaction.  Of course, PopUpMenu and FillInTheBlankMorph were modified to first signal a ProvideAnswerNotification and if someone handles that (e.g. the enclosing block) then the user interaction will be circumvented and the provided answer of the enclosing block will be used.  The basic syntax looks like:

	[self confirm: 'Install spyware?'] valueSupplyingAnswer: #('Install spyware?' false)

There a few variants on this theme making it easy to provide a literal list of answers for the block so that you can handle a bunch of questions in a block with appropriate answers.

Additionally, it is possible to suppress Object>>inform: modal dialog boxes as these get in the way of automating anything.  After applying this changeset you should be able to tryout the following code snippets to see the variants on this theme that are available.

Examples:

So you don't need any introduction here -- this one works like usual.
[self inform: 'hello'. #done] value.

Now let's suppress all inform: messages.
[self inform: 'hello'; inform: 'there'. #done] valueSuppressingAllMessages.

Here we can just suppress a single inform: message.
[self inform: 'hi'; inform: 'there'. #done] valueSuppressingMessages: #('there')

Here you see how you can suppress a list of messages.
[self inform: 'hi'; inform: 'there'; inform: 'bill'. #done] valueSuppressingMessages: #('hi' 'there')

Enough about inform:, let's look at confirm:. As you see this one works as expected.
[self confirm: 'You like Squeak?'] value

Let's supply answers to one of the questions -- check out the return value.
[{self confirm: 'You like Smalltalk?'. self confirm: 'You like Squeak?'}]
	valueSupplyingAnswer: #('You like Smalltalk?' true)

Here we supply answers using only substrings of the questions (for simplicity).
[{self confirm: 'You like Squeak?'. self confirm: 'You like MVC?'}]
	valueSupplyingAnswers: #( ('Squeak' true) ('MVC' false) )

This time let's answer all questions exactly the same way.
[{self confirm: 'You like Squeak?'. self confirm: 'You like Morphic?'}]
	valueSupplyingAnswer: true
	
And, of course, we can answer FillInTheBlank questions in the same manner.
[FillInTheBlank request: 'What day is it?']
	valueSupplyingAnswer: 'the first day of the rest of your life'
	
We can also return whatever the initialAnswer of the FillInTheBlank was by using the #default answer.
[FillInTheBlank request: 'What day is it?' initialAnswer: DateAndTime now dayOfWeekName]
	valueSupplyingAnswer: #default
	
Finally, you can also do regex matches on any of the question text (or inform text) (should you have VB-Regex enhancements in your image).
[FillInTheBlank request: 'What day is it?']
	valueSupplyingAnswers: { {'What day.*\?'. DateAndTime now dayOfWeekName} }
