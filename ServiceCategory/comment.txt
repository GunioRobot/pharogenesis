I represent a category of services that can be added to a menu.
I can be displayed as a menu or button bar containing my services.
I am also a subclass of ServiceAction, so I can form a subcategory of another service category.

Like services, I am created in methods of a ServiceProvider, in the 'services' method protocol.
The template to create a service category is the following:

methodNameAndServiceCategoryId
	^ ServiceCategory 
		text: 'Menu text' 
		button: 'Button  text' 
		description: 'Longer descriptive text appearing in help balloons'
	
To put services in a service category, you have to use the Service Browser, located in the word menu, under the 'Preferences and Services' menu item.
In it, you can look up for the name of your category, and enter service identifiers as children
of the category in the associatedd text field, separating them with spaces.
