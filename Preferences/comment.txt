A general mechanism to store preference choices.  The default setup treats any symbol as a potential boolean flag; flags unknown to the preference dictionary are always returned as false.  It is also possible to store non-boolean data in the preference table.  sw 8/91
	To open the control panel:		Preferences openFactoredPanel

All messages are to the class.
	Preferences logDebuggerStackToFile
You can make up a new preference any time.  Do not define a new message in Preferences class.  When Preferences does not understand a selector, it looks in the flags dictionary.  It calls:
	Preferences valueOfFlag: #logDebuggerStackToFile

To set a preference,
	Preferences setPreference: #logDebuggerStackToFile toValue: false.
Or,
	Preferences disable: #logDebuggerStackToFile.
Or to turn it on,
	Preferences enable: #logDebuggerStackToFile.
