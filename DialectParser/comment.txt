This Parser is part of a package designed to allow for experiments with alternatives to ST-80 syntax.  The particular alternative offered by this parser eliminates colons, left-arrows and up-arrows, and adds prefix keywords for common control constructs.

ST-80									SQ-00
-------									-------
a + b between: c and: c + 4				a + b between (c) and (c + 4)
a _ 3.0									Set a to 3.0
^ self size + 3							Return self size + 3
a > b									Test (a > b)
	ifTrue: ['greater']						ifTrue ['greater']
	ifFalse: ['less']							ifFalse ['less']
1 to: 9 do:								Repeat (1) to (9) do
	[:i | Transcript cr; show: i]				[Set i. | Transcript cr; show (i)]

The use of prefix keywords is currently ad-hoc;  in other words they are built into the parser, and there is not a way to define a method pattern to include a prefix keyword.  Most of the work has been done to support this, though, as selectors can now have the form
	#:prefix:kwd1:kwd2:
and they will respond appropriately to #keywords and #numArgs.

A test method in the class ensures that every method in the system can be pretty-printed in the alternative syntax, and that compiling the resulting text produces exactly the same bytecodes as the original method.
