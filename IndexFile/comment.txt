I represent an index for the messages in a mail database. I acts like a dictionary that maps unique message ID's to IndexFileEntry objects.

The index file is read into memory in its entirety and kept there for the duration of a mail reading session. It should be stored back to disk at the end of the session, or after a major change, such as fetching new mail. If necessary, it can be completely recreated by scanning the messages file.
