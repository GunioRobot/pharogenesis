This class is for switching external prim calls (primitiveExternalCall) on and off.

It is best suited for permanently switching plugin calls off while preserving the possibility to switch them on later. For plugin testing purposes you probably should use PCCByLiterals for temporarily switch on/off them instead.

It works on a source code basis by compilation:
	Disabling works by putting an enabled prim call into a special comment followed by a recompile to transform it into a disabled one.
	Enabling works by pulling the disabled prim call out of the special comment followed by a recompile to transform it into an enabled one.

As a consequence, enabling of prims only works with method sources containing the mentioned special comment, which normally has been generated by this tool for disabling the corresponding prim.

Please look into superclass PrimCallControllerAbstract for more info and the user interface.

 No instVars here: look into superclass.

Implementation note:
To harden it for sunit testing purposes some special accessing of the source code has been necessary: to avoid accessing different processes a sources file at once, followed by generating garbage, the process priority of actions leading to these accesses has been increased (sunit tests run in the background). A better solution would be to introduce a source file locking mechanism.
