WordGameLetterMorph implements letter boxes for type-in and display of letter in word games.  Several variant displays are supported, depending on the setting of style, and blanks can be displayed as black boxes or empty letter boxes.

Default support for type-in is distributed between this class and WordGamePaneMorph
