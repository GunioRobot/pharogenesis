Class Heap implements a special data structure commonly referred to as 'heap'. Heaps are more efficient than SortedCollections if:
a) Elements are only removed at the beginning
b) Elements are added with arbitrary sort order.
The sort time for a heap is O(n log n) in all cases.

Instance variables:
	array		<Array>		the data repository
	tally		<Integer>	the number of elements in the heap
	sortBlock	<Block|nil>	a two-argument block defining the sort order,
							or nil in which case the default sort order is
								[:element1 :element2| element1 <= element2]
