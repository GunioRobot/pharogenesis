For Simulating the Interpreter only.  Coercing an Integer to a pointer (eg. cCoerce:to: 'char *') returns a CArray.  A CArray responds to at: and at:put: by reading/writing from the memory of the interpreter that sent the cCoerce:to: message in the first place.  A CArray responds to arithmetic by returning the new address.  Since longAt: sends // to its given address this is where the CArray converts back to a Integer for the memory fetch to work.
