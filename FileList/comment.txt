I am model that can be used to navigate the host file system. By omitting the volume list, file list, and template panes from the view, I can also be used as the model for an editor on an individual file.

FileLists can now see FTP servers anywhere on the net.  In the volume list menu: 
fill in server info...		Gives you a form to register a new ftp server you want to use.
open server...		Choose a server to connect to.
local disk			Go back to looking at your local volume.

Still undone (you can contribute code):
[ ] Using a Proxy server to get out through a firewall.  What is the convention for proxy servers with FTP?
[ ] Fill in the date and size info in the list of remote files.  Allow sorting by it.  New smarts needed in (ServerDirectory fileNameFormattedFrom:sizePad:sortMode:).
[ ] Currently the FileList has no way to delete a directory.  Since you can't select a directory without going into it, it would have to be deleting the current directory.  Which would usually be empty.
