BitBltSimulation comment:
'This class implements BitBlt, much as specified in the Blue Book spec.

Performance has been enhanced through the use of pointer variables such as sourceIndex and destIndex, and by separating several special cases of the inner loop.

Operation has been extended to color, with support for 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32-bit pixel sizes.  Conversion between different pixel sizes is facilitated by accepting an optional color map.

In addition to the original 16 combination rules, this BitBlt supports
	16	fail (to simulate paint)
	17	fail (to simulate mask)
	18	sourceWord + destinationWord
	19	sourceWord - destinationWord
	20	rgbAdd: sourceWord with: destinationWord
	21	rgbSub: sourceWord with: destinationWord
	22	rgbDiff: sourceWord with: destinationWord
	23	tallyIntoMap: destinationWord
	24	alphaBlend: sourceWord with: destinationWord
	25	pixPaint: sourceWord with: destinationWord
	26	pixMask: sourceWord with: destinationWord
	27	rgbMax: sourceWord with: destinationWord
	28	rgbMin: sourceWord with: destinationWord
	29	rgbMin: sourceWord bitInvert32 with: destinationWord

This implementation has also been fitted with an experimental "warp drive" that allows abritrary scaling and rotation (and even limited affine deformations) with all BitBlt storage modes supported.
