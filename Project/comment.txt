A Project stores the state of a complete Squeak desktop, including
the windows, and the currently active changeSet.  A project knows who
its parent project is.  When you change projects, whether by entering
or exiting, the screen state of the project being exited is saved in
that project.

A project is retained by its view in the parent world.  It is
effectively named by the name of its changeSet, which can be changed
either by renaming in a changeSorter, or by editing the label of its
view from the parent project.

As the site of major context switch, Projects are the locus of
swapping between the old MVC and the new Morphic worlds.  The
distinction is based on whether the variable 'world' contains a
WorldMorph or a ControlManager.

Saving and Loading
Projects may be stored on the disk in external format.  (Project
named: 'xxx') exportSegment, or choose 'store project on file...'.
Projects may be loaded from a server and stored back.  Storing on a
server never overwrites;  it always makes a new version.  A project
remembers the url of where it lives in urlList.  The list is length
one, for now.  The url may point to a local disk instead of a server.
All projects that the user looks at, are cached in the Squeaklet
folder.  Sorted by server.  The cache holds the most recent version
only.

When a project is loaded into Squeak, its objects are converted to
the current version.  There are three levels of conversion.  First,
each object is converted from raw bits to an object in its old
format.  Then it is sent some or all of these messages:
	comeFullyUpOnReload: smartRefStream  		Used to
re-discover an object that already exists in this image, such as a
resource, global variable, Character, or Symbol.  (sent to objects in
outPointers)
	convertToCurrentVersion: varDict refStream: smartRefStrm
		fill in fields that have been added to a class since
the object was stored.  Used to set the extra inst var to a default
value.  Or, return a new object of a different class.  (sent to
objects that changed instance variables)
	fixUponLoad: aProject refStream: smartRefStrm
	change the object due to conventions that have changed on the
project level.  (sent to all objects in the incoming project)

Here is the calling sequence for storing out a Project:
Project saveAs
Project storeOnServer
Project storeOnServerWithProgressInfo
Project storeOnServerInnards
Project exportSegmentFileName:directory:
Project exportSegmentWithChangeSet:fileName:directory:
ImageSegment writeForExportWithSources:inDirectory:changeSet:
---------
Isolation (not used any more)
When you accept a method, the entire system feels the change, except
projects that are "isolated".  In an isolated project, all new global
variables (including new classes) arestored in the project-local
environment, and all changes to preexisting classes are revoked when
you leave the project.  When you enter another project, that
project's changes are invoked.  Invocation and revocation are handled
efficiently by swapping pointers.  To make a project be isolated,
choose 'isolate changes of this project' from the 'changes...'
section of the screen menu.  You can use an isolated project for
making dangerous change to a system, and you can get out if it
crashes.  A foreign application can have the separate environment it
wants.  Also, you can freeze part of the system for a demo that you
don't want to disturb.  An isolated project shares methods with all
subprojects inside it, unless they are isolated themselves.   Each
isolated project is the head of a tree of projects with which it
shares all methods.

You may 'assert' all changes ever made in the current project to take
effect above this project.  This amounts to exporting all the globals
in the current environment, and zapping the revocation lists to that
the current state of the world will remain in force upon exit from
this project.

[Later: A project may be 'frozen'.  Asserts do not apply to it after
that.  (Great for demos.)  You should be informed when an assert was
blocked in a frozen project.]

Class definitions are layered by the isolation mechanism.  You are
only allowed to change the shape of a class in projects that lie
within its isolation scope.  All versions of the methods are
recompiled, in all projects.  If you remove an inst var that is in
use in an isolated project, it will become an Undeclared global.  It
is best not to remove an inst var when it is being used in another
isolated project. [If we recompile them all, why can't we diagnose
the problem before allowing the change??]

Senders and Implementors do not see versions of a method in isolated
projects.  [again, we might want to make this possible at a cost].
When you ask for versions of a method, you will not get the history
in other isolated projects.

Moving methods and classes between changeSets, and merging changeSets
has no effect on which methods are in force.  But, when you look at a
changeSet from a different isolated project, the methods will contain
code that is not in force.  A changeSet is just a list of method
names, and does not keep separate copies of any code.

When finer grained assertion is needed, use the method (aProject
assertClass: aClass from: thisProject warn: warnConflicts).

How isolated changes work: The first time a class changes, store its
MethodDictionary object.  Keep parallel arrays of associations to
Classes and MethodDictionaries.  Traverse these and install them when
you enter an "ioslated project".  When you leave, store this
project's own MethodDictionaries there.
	To do an assert, we must discover which methods changed here,
and which changed only in the project we are asserting into.  There
is one copy of the 'virgin' method dictionaries in the system.  It is
always being temporarily stored by the currently inForce isolated
project.

isolatedHead - true for the top project, and for each isolated
project.  false or nil for any subproject that shares all methods
with its parent project.

inForce -  true if my methods are installed now.  false if I am
dormant. [is this equivalent to self == Project Current?]

classArray - list of associations to classes

methodDictArray - the method dictionaries of those classes before we
started changing methods.  They hang onto the original
compiledMethods.  (If this project is dormant, it contains the method
dictionaries of those classes as they will be here, in this project).

orgArray - the class organizations of the classes in classArray.

UsingIsolation (class variable) - No longer used.

When you want to save a project in export format from within that
very project, it gets tricky.  We set two flags in parentProject,
exit to it, and let parentProject write the project.
ProjectViewMorph in parentProject checks in its step method, does the
store, clears the flags, and reenters the subProject.
