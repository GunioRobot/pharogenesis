StringHolderController comment:
'I represent a ParagraphEditor for a single paragraph of text, omitting alignment commands. I provide items in the yellow button menu so that the text selection can be evaluated and so that the contents of the model can be stored or restored.
	doIt	evaluate the text selection as an expression
	printIt	same as doIt but insert a description of the result after the selection
	accept	store the contents of the StringHolder into the model
	cancel	store the contents of the model into the StringHolder'
