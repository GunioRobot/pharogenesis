The CrosticPanel, as its name suggests, is a tool for decoding acrostic puzzles, such as are presented on the puzzle pages of some Sunday newspapers.  Much of the capability is inherited from the two WordGame classes used.  To try it out, choose newMorph/Games/CrosticPanel in a morphic project, or execute, in any project:

	CrosticPanel new openInWorld

The instance variables of this class include...
	letterMorphs (in superclass)  a collection of all the letterMorphs in this panel
	quote		a string, being the entire quote in uppercase with no blanks
	clues		a collection of the clue strings
	answers		a collection of the answer indices.
				For each answer, this is an array of the indices into the quote string.

The final structure of a CrosticPanel is as follows
	self					a CrosticPanel			the overall holder
		quotePanel		a CrosticQuotePanel		holds the grid of letters from the quote
		cluesPanel		an AlignmentMorph		holds most of the clue rows
		cluesCol2		an AlignmentMorph		holds the rest of the clue rows

Each clue row is a horizontal AlignmentMorph with a textMorph and another alignmentMorph full of the letterMorphs for the answer.
