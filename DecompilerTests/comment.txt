Apparently the decompiler does not really work totally.
Here are a bunch of methods that can help improving the decompiler:
	- blockingClasses return class for which it is impossible to decompile methods 
	- failures are problems that lead to a DNU
	- decompilerDiscrepancies are the results of running decompileTestHelper..as you see the pattern 	
	is quite present.
