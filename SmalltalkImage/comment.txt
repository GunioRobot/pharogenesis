I represent the SmalltalkImage and partly the VM. Using my current instance you can 
	- get the value of some VM parameters, system arguments, vm profiling,
	endianess status, external objects,....

	- save the image, manage sources

As you will notice browsing my code I'm a fat class having still too much responsibility.
But this is life. sd-2 July 2003

PS: if someone wants to split me go ahead.
