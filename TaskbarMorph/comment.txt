Themed synchronous taskbar (not using #step to poll windows). The buttons provide visual feedback as to whether a window is active or minimised (collapsed) plus a popup menu with options to restore, minimise, maximise and close the associated window. Optional (via Preferences) preview of the window while mouse is over a taskbar button.
See the preference browser (PreferenceBrowser open) under "docking bars" for options.
