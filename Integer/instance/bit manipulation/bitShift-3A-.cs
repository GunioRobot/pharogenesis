bitShift: shiftCount 
	"Answer an Integer whose value (in twos-complement representation) is 
	the receiver's value (in twos-complement representation) shifted left by 
	the number of bits indicated by the argument. Negative arguments shift 
	right. Zeros are shifted in from the right in left shifts."
