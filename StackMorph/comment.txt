The instance variables of interest here -- some are presently inherited from PasteupMoprh --


dataInstances            this is the stack's entire data-base
backgrounds
currentDataInstance    Points to an element of dataInstances

userFrameRectangle



The primary abstraction here iis the Background and its instances.  I'd like to call this thing, which is kind of a Stack and a kind of database, 

The Background definition is the Playfield
We swap playfields in a Book.  Therefore, a Stack is like a book and a Playfield is like a background.
