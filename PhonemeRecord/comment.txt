I represent a single phoneme. I contain the phoneme's name and an integer that represents the mouth position associated with this phoneme. This integer can be used as an index to select the mouth shape for an animated character. I also contain a 'features vector' derived from an analysis of my sound; this 'features vector' is the basis of matching during phoneme recognition. I also retain the original sound from which the features were computed so that it can be re-analyzed to create a new feature vector when the analysis algorithm is changed.
