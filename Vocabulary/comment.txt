A Vocabulary can be either be *abstract*, i.e. associated with a *class*, or it can be *bound to an instance*.  The form that is bound to an instance is still in its infancy however.

object				in the *bound* form, an actual object is associated with the vocabulary
limitClass			in the *bound* form, an actual limit class is assocaited with the vocabulary

AllMethodInterfaces	This class variable is available to hold on to all method interfaces
						defined in the system, regardless of class.  Not deployed in 
						the first version of this code to be circulated externally.

AllVocabularies		A dictionary associating symbols with actual abstract vocabulary instances

Hints on making a vocabulary for a new foreign language.  You need build a method like #addGermanVocabulary.  Execute

	Transcript show: Vocabulary eToyVocabulary strings.

and copy the text from the transcript to the method you are building.
	A cheap trick to get started is to use a web site that translates.  Here is how.  For an entry like:  

(clearTurtleTrails			'clear pen trails'			'Clear all the pen trails in the interior.')

	substitute exclamation points for single quotes by using Alt-shift-j.  Most of the statements are imperatives.

(clearOwnersPenTrails !clear all pen trails! !clear all pen trails in my containing play field!) 

	This translates to

(ClearOwnersPenTrails! reinigt allen Kugelschreiber verfolgt! ! Reinigt allen Kugelschreiber Pfade in meinem enthaltenden Spiel Feld sind!) 

	Which is laughable, and will certainly stimulate the author to improve it.
