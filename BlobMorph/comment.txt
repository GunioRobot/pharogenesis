The Blob was written by David N Smith.  It started out as a simple test of the CurveMorph and ended up as an oozing, pulsating, repulsive mess which will wander across your screen until killed.  Each instance has its own rate of oozing, so some are faster than others.  It's not good for anything.

Try:
	BlobMorph new openInWorld
