ChangeSet comment:
'My instances keep track of the changes made to a system, so the user can make an incremental fileOut. The order in which changes are made is not remembered.

classChanges:  Dictionary {class name -> Set {eg, #change, #rename, etc}}.
methodChanges:  Dictionary {class name -> IdentityDictionary {selector -> {eg, #change, #remove, etc}}.
classRemoves:  Set {class name (original)}.
methodRemoves:  Dictionary {(Array with: class name with: selector) -> (Array with: source pointer with: category)}.
name: a String used to name the changeSet, and thus any associated project or fileOut.
preamble and postscript:  two strings that serve as prefix (useful for documentation) and suffix (useful for doits) to the fileout of the changeSet.'
