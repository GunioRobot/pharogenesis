A light source of this type has a color and a position. Is has no direction, but emits its light into all directions. (Use spot lights when you need both a position and a direction.) A positional light must have an attenuation. The attenuation defines the reduction of the light intensity at increasing distances.

Creation of a positional light:

     light1 := B3DPositionalLight new.
     light1 position: 100 @ 0 @ 0.
     light1 attenuation: (B3DLightAttenuation constant: 1.0 linear: 0.5 squared: 0.0).
     light1 lightColor: (B3DMaterialColor color: (Color r: 0.8 g: 0.15 b: 0.15)).
	scene lights add: light1.
