A resource is a document that is NOT a package. Thus, it is used for all the things interesting to register on SM that aren't packages. The are three major differences with resources:

- A resource keeps no track of version history like packages do with package releases. It only has a field for the current version.
- A resource can be embedded inside the map instead of being a document reached by a URL.
- A resource can be associated with another SMObject, the subject.

However, resources respond to some of the same actions as PackageReleases.
