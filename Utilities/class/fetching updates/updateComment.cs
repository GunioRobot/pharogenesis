* Do not use %, /, *, space, or more than one period in the name of an update file.
* The update name does not need to have any relation to the version name.
* Figure out which versions of the system the update makes sense for.
* Add the name of the file to each version's category below.
* Put this file and the update file on all of the servers.
*
* To make a new version of the system:  Pick a name for it (no restrictions)
* Put # and exactly that name on a new line at the end of this file.
* During the release process, fill in exactly that name in the dialog box.
