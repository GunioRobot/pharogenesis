A morph whose submorphs comprise a paste-up of rectangular subparts which "show through".

Facilities commonly needed on pages of graphical presentations and on simulation playfields, such as the painting of new objects, turtle trails, gradient fills, background paintings, parts-bin behavior, collision-detection, etc., are (or will be) provided.

This class is young and still under construction, and a number of its (many) instance variables are not yet fully deployed.
