relaxGripOnVariableNames
	"Abandon any memory of specific variable names that should be preserved.  The overall situation here is not yet completely understood, and this relaxation is basically always done on each reassessment of the background shape nowadays.  But this doesn't feel quite right, because if the user has somehow intervened to specify certain name preference we should perhaps honored it.  Or perhaps that is no longer relevant.  ????"
