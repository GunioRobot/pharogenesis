A button associated with a particular player and script.  You can "tear off" such a button for any etoy script, using menu items available in both Viewers and Scriptors.  The button initially is given a label reflecting its player and script name, but this can be edited via the button's halo menu, as can its other appearance parameters.  Such buttons are automatically kept in synch when the object's name or the script name change.
