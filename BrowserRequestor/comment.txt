I am a requestor specialized to fetch information in a Browser.
I can ask a browser its selected class and selected method for example.
If the RB is installed too, I can also fetch ast nodes in the browser's selected
method.

I am the default requestor for CodeHolder and it's subclasses.

To be integrated with services, alternative browsers, such as the OmniBrowser and Whisker should define a specialized requestor subclassing this one. A few core messages would need to be redefined, such as getClass, getMessage ... to be adapted to the browser's data structures. 
Only a few of them have to be overridden, the majority of the requests rely on a few base ones.
