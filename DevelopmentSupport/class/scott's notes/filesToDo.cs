The file browser sucks in numerous ways.

One totally brain-damaged thing is that when you try to dismiss it, if there have been edits, you're asked 'is it okay to cancel changes', and when you say yes, it reads in the entire damned file again, just in time to close it.

Upgrade its menus.

Don't read in the entire damned file every time you move the window!
