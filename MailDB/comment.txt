I am the in-memory representation of a Celeste mail database. A mail database named "current" consists of three files:

	current.messages	-- an append-only file containing the full content of all messages
	current.index		-- an index of all messages in the messages file that maps unique
						   message ID's to index entries containing some header information
						   and the offset of the full message in the .messages file
	current.categories	-- maps category names to collections of message ID's

Each open mail database has a MailDB object that manages these three files. Operations such as fetching a message given its unique ID and finding out which messages are in which category are supported by the MailDB object. It also supports incorporating new messages (reading mail), message editing and deletions, and message file compaction and recovery.
