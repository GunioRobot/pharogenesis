primInitializeNetwork: resolverSemaIndex
	"Initialize the network drivers on platforms that need it, such as the Macintosh. Since mobile computers may not always be connected to a network, this method should NOT be called automatically at startup time; rather, it should be called when first starting a networking application. It is a noop if the network driver has already been initialized. If non-zero, resolverSemaIndex is the index of a VM semaphore to be associated with the network name resolver. This semaphore will be signalled when the resolver status changes, such as when a name lookup query is completed."
	"Note: some platforms (e.g., Mac) only allow only one name lookup query at a time, so a manager process should be used to serialize resolver lookup requests."

this machine is not connected to a network.'.
