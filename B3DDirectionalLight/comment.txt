This light has a color and a direction. The position of the light source is at infinity; the light rays are parallel. The intensity of such a light does not diminish with increasing distance. Three differently colored directional lights from different directions are often a good initial choice to color a scene with lights.

Creation of a directional light:

    light := B3DDirectionalLight new.
    light direction: 10 @ 0 @ 10.	
    light lightColor: (B3DMaterialColor color: (Color r: 0.1 g: 0.2 b: 0.0)).
    scene lights add: light.
