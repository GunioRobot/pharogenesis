I provide the user-interface for playing MPEG movies, including play/stop/rewind buttons and volume and position sliders. To create an instance of me, evaluate:

  MPEGMoviePlayerMorph new openInWorld

Then use the "open" button to open an MPEG movie file. This class supplies the front panel; the real work is done by MPEGDisplayMorph and StreamingMP3Sound.
