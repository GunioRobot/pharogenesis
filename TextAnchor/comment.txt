TextAnchors support anchoring of images in text.  A TextAnchor exists as an attribute of text emphasis, and it gets control like a FontReference, through the emphasizeScanner: message.  Depending on whether its anchoredMorph is a Morph or a Form, it repositions the morph, or displays the form respectively.  The coordination between composition, display and selection can best be understood by browsing the various implementations of placeEmbeddedObject:.

In the morphic world, simply embed any morph in text.  In the old world, you can create an image reference using code such as the following.
	ParagraphEditor new clipboardTextPut:
		(Text string: '*'
			attribute: (TextAnchor new anchoredMorph: Form fromUser))
In this case you select a piece of the screen, and it gets anchored to a one-character text in the editor's past buffer.  If you then paste into some other text, you will see the image as an embedded image.
