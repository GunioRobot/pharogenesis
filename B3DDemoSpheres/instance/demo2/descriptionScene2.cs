descriptionScene2

  ^'A single sphere with texture is shown. No lights are used. The texture is used to color the surface with a chess board pattern.

The sphere emits yellow light, The green texture can be seen in yellow light. When you change the light emission of the sphere to red, the sphere will be drawn black (because red and green have no colors in common. Yellow and green have.) It is of couse also possible to see the texture when the light emission of the sphere is set to white (or to light gray) 

Try again all five wheels of the display morph. You will find, that the texture adds a spacial impression that you missed in the first example.'
