descriptionScene3

  ^'A single sphere with texture is shown in ambient green light. The green texture is used to color the surface with a chess board pattern.
To see the texture, the material of the surface must have an ambient part that contains green. (Suitable colors are white, gray, yellow, but not red or blue.)

For a better understanding of how light color and material properties work together, you should change the color of the ambient light and the ambient part of the surface material. You will find that the surface is rendered in the common color of the ambient light and the ambient part of the material. A black surface means that there is no common color.'
